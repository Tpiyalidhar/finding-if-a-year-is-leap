The file contains the code that I wrote to find if a year is leap
for x in range(1500,2011):
    remainder= x%4
    rem2= x%100
    rem3=x%400
    if remainder==0
       if rem2==0
          if rem3==0
             print(x,"is a leap year")
           else:
            print(x,"not a leap year")
        else:
            print(x, "is a leap year")
    else:
        print(x, "not a leap year")
